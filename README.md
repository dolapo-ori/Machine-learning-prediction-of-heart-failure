# Machine-learning-prediction-of-heart-failure
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, 
which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide.
Heart failure (HF) is a prominent contributor to illness and death on a global scale, imposing a substantial strain on healthcare systems.
Heart failure (HF) affects more than 60 million individuals globally.
Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.

Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity,
physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.

People with heart failure or who have cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension,
diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.
Prompt detection and management of heart failure at an early stage are crucial for enhancing patient outcomes. However, conventional approaches frequently depend on clinical assessment and basic statistical models, which may miss subtle risk factors and complex interactions.
## Aim and Objectives
The aim of this project is to shed light on how to use encoders to encode a dataset to make it numerical and in a certain range, as well as how to scale the data using standard scaler. Most importantly, the use of the multi layer perceptron on a dataset to achieve an accuracy of over 80% and how to tune hyperparameters.
